# mymenu
Character-based MySQL CRUD menu for the Linux terminal.

This project was custom made for a school database homework assignment. 
It works exclusively with the MySQL database built with the included .sql file.
The menu runs from a Bash script file and has MySQL hardcoded in to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records in the tables.

## Install
1) Transfer both files (menu_mysql_sayre.sh and dorm_tables_sayre.sql) to a Linux box, I used Ubuntu on a VM

2) Run the sql file to create the database, dummy data will fill into the tables automatically

3) Run the menu and enjoy
